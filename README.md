# Estimating-Severity-of-Knee-Osteoarthritis-Using-Deep-Convolution-Networks-From-X-ray-Images

• Developed an ensemble of neural network models capable of categorizing X-ray images according to the degree of
osteoarthritis.

• CNN used: EfficientNet, DenseNet, InceptionV3, Mobilenet.

• Developed the dataset - Manually created image Image masks for the X-ray images to perform segmentation.

• The area of injury is segmented out of the image and the distance between the knee bones is calculated.

• Calculating the distance plays a vital role in assessing the disease’s seriousness and predicting the probability of
progressing to the next stage.
